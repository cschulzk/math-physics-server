# Math App
This app is the begining of a longer term project to build an app for calculating and displaying math and physics phenomenon. I'll build it out in my free time. Long term goals include temperature calculations in n-dimensional solids and the trajectorty of electrons in a laser focus.

There are size limits put on the arguements that are accepted in order to make the computation times small for even small computers. These limits can be adjusted to match the infrastructure the app is running on.

# Functions to add
 - Temperature in a solid rod of homogenous material.
 - Trigonometric functions
 - Fibonacci sequence (return first n members of the sequence; return the nth member of the sequence)
 - Calucate the area of regular shapes

# Features to add
  - Make a root route that returns a 'directory' of the operations that are available
  - Update the opeartions root routes to provide instructions on how to use the route, in addition to the link with explanation of the operation.
  - Move request parameters to the URL to make the app easier to use for a wider audience
  - Add file transfer functions

# Dependencies
After setting up your virtual environment, run `pip install Flask`. This is currently the only dependency.
